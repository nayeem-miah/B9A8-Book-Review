        <p className="text-center mb-10">Reading books is extremely important. If you read books avidly, apparently, you obtain lots of good information. As a result, you become knowledgeable.
        Reading books is completely overlooked by most people across the world. Most adults donâ€™t read because they are unaware of the essence of reading. Countless people stop reading books by the time they complete high school, never to open a book again. Unfortunately, school books are not that informative because formal education is very deficient. Real knowledge is found in bookshops.</p>
